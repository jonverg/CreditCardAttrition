MGSC 310 Final Project: Credit Card Attrition Prediction
Ellie Strande, Ruby Link, Jonathan Vergonio

Credit card attrition, also known as customer churn, refers to customers discontinuing their relationship with a business or organization. 
In the context of the credit industry, credit attrition occurs when customers close their credit accounts, stop using credit cards, or switch to competitors’ services. 
The ability to accurately predict credit attrition is crucial for businesses in the financial sector to proactively identify customers who are at high risk of attrition and take appropriate measures to retain them. 

# Conclusion
  From the 3 algorithms, the Random Forest model is the most successful and practical of the three and in a business setting, should be the model that is utilized for bank churn rates. The model increased the accuracy of true positive cases – individuals who were predicted to churn and actually did. The sensitivity increased from approximately 50% in the decision tree model to around 75%, as observed in our random forest model. Additionally, when comparing the random forest model to the logistic regression, the overall accuracy increased from 80% to 90%, which is a 10% jump, and immensely improved both the sensitivity and specificity rates. 
Our data analysis has effectively demonstrated what predictors are important when assessing churn and how banks should use the information from each of the three models to mitigate high attrition rates. As seen in all models, the total transaction count is the highest indicator of credit card attrition and should be closely monitored by banks. In the decision tree model, we were able to observe that total transaction counts under 55 put a customer most at risk for credit card attrition. Other important variables include total revolving balance, months inactive in the last 12 months, and credit limit. Banks can use the discussed findings to target uneasy customers and provide incentives like credit card rewards or special deals to deter churn and increase or continue a bank's success.
