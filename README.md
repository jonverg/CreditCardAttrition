Credit card attrition, also known as customer churn, refers to customers discontinuing their relationship with a business or organization. 
In the context of the credit industry, credit attrition occurs when customers close their credit accounts, stop using credit cards, or switch to competitorsâ€™ services. 
The ability to accurately predict credit attrition is crucial for businesses in the financial sector to proactively identify customers who are at high risk of attrition and take appropriate measures to retain them.
